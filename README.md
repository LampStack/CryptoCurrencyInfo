# Coin Currency Info Web App

This repository contains a simple web application built with HTML, CSS (using Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript. The app allows users to select a cryptocurrency from a dropdown menu and retrieves real-time price and trading information using the Binance API. The fetched data is then displayed in a user-friendly format.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The structure of the web page is defined using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).

- **CSS (Tailwind CSS):** Styling is implemented using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The classes from Tailwind CSS help in achieving a responsive and visually appealing design.

- **JavaScript:** The functionality of the web app is powered by JavaScript. It handles user interactions, triggers API requests, and dynamically updates the displayed information.

- **Binance API:** The application utilizes the Binance API to fetch real-time data about selected cryptocurrencies. The API provides information such as the last price, high and low prices in the last 24 hours, price change, and trading volume.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. Select a cryptocurrency from the dropdown menu.

3. The application will fetch and display real-time information about the selected cryptocurrency, including the last price, 24-hour high and low prices, price change, and trading volume.

## Code Overview

- The HTML file (`index.html`) defines the structure of the web page, including the form with a dropdown menu for selecting cryptocurrencies and a container for displaying the fetched data.

- The CSS file (loaded from `https://cdn.tailwindcss.com`) provides styling using Tailwind CSS classes, creating a visually appealing and responsive layout.

- The JavaScript code (`script` tag in `index.html`) includes functions for fetching data from the Binance API, updating the displayed information, and handling the page load event.
